# GoSneak

The ninja of process injection! Silently slipping into processes with the stealth and precision of a Golang-coded shadow. Shh, it's so sneaky, even the bytes don't hear it coming!

A small snippet from my private Go based software and server control framework, showcasing some simple process injection written in Go and C. This is purely PROOF OF CONCEPT and simply injects a DLL into a process for it to be run. This is in NO WAY to be used for malicious purposes and I DO NOT ENDORSE this code being used for malicious purposes.
