# GoSneak

A small snippet from my private Go based malware (for red team operations NOT criminal / malicious) and server control framework, showcasing some simple process injection written in Go and C. This is purely PROOF OF CONCEPT and simply injects a DLL into a process for it to be run. This is in NO WAY to be used for malicious purposes and I DO NOT ENDORSE this code being used for malicious purposes. 

The injector is mostly in C, wrapped in some Go for fun, showing cross compatability of classical C development with a higher level language such as Go. I have found there are actual benefits to doing this in respect of anti-detection; something I may blog about in the future!
